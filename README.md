# Portfolio
This portfolio is designed to present my work and experiences in a visually appealing and accessible way. The project makes use of Vue, CSS animations (using AOS), and SVG graphics to enhance the user experience.

## Key Features
- Dynamic Content: Utilizes Vue for smooth, interactive, and dynamic UI updates.
- Animated Effects: Includes AOS (Animate On Scroll) for fade, zoom, and other animations that activate as users scroll.
- Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices (gonna be completed for phone size devices).


## Technologies Used
- Vue.js: Framework for managing data and components.
- AOS (Animate On Scroll): Library for handling scroll animations.
- HTML/CSS: Custom styles and layout for responsive design.
SVG Graphics: Custom SVG wave graphics create a clean, stylish separation between sections. (tool used for generating waves: https://www.shapedivider.app/)
